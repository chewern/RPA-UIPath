# UIPath
 This is a mini project to scrape some share prices from Yahoo Finance and ading the daily scraped data to an Excel file.
 
 ## Thoughts on UI Path
 Previously I have tried using python script with various techniques, such as BeautifulSoup, to scrape data off the internet, specifically Property Guru website.
 
 I wanted to automate property search updates because I find it tedious to look through property guru to hunt for new property listings in projets that I am interested in.
 
 Alas, all these efforts failed because Propertyguru has implemented some scripts on their website to deter webscrapers, probably because they were hit once by scrapers who told all of Propertyguru's listings and created another competing website.
 
 So perhaps UI Path can do what typical webscraping codes can't do? Will try it out when I have time and mood.
